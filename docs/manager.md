# Stream Manager

### What is a stream manager?
Panic Finance's Stream Manager allows you to easily manage your open streams. With the Stream Manager, you can:

Set a closing time and date for your existing streams.
Protect your streams against liquidations.
Close your streams after transferring a certain amount of tokens.
By setting a closing time and date for your streams, you can ensure that they will be closed automatically at the desired time, without having to manually trigger the action. This is particularly useful for streams that have an intended end date or start date, such as streaming payroll, subscriptions, and token vesting.

Additionally, the Stream Manager protects your streams against liquidations, which can occur when the balance of the underlying collateral falls below a certain threshold. With Panic Finance, you can be sure that your streams will remain safe and secure.

Finally, the Stream Manager allows you to close your streams after transferring a certain amount of tokens.
